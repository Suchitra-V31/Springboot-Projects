The provided project code is for a web application focused on network utilization. 

Here's a breakdown of its components and functionality:

HTML Structure: 

	- The HTML file defines the structure of the web page. It includes:

		- Dropdown menus for selecting a city, type, and value.
	
		- A button to fetch the report.
	
		- An empty <div> element to display the table.
	
JavaScript Logic:

	Fetch Functions: 
		=> The getCityList() and getTypeList() functions fetch data (presumably city and type lists) from the server using the Fetch API. They populate the dropdown menus with the received data.
	Value Selection: 
		=> The getValue() function retrieves the selected values from the dropdown menus when the user makes a selection.
	Report Generation:
		=> When the user clicks the "GET REPORT" button, an event listener calls the getReport function. This function fetches utilization data from the server based on the selected city, type, and value. 
		Upon receiving the data, it dynamically generates a table and populates it with the retrieved data.

Styling:

	- The provided CSS styles the HTML elements for better presentation.
	- It styles the dropdown menus, button, and table for improved readability and user experience.
Service Annotation:

	- The @Service annotation marks this class as a service component in a Spring application context. 
	- It's typically used to indicate that this class contains business logic and serves as a service layer component.
	
Database Operations:

	- The class contains methods to interact with a MySQL database to fetch data related to cities, types, values, and utilization.
	
	- Each method corresponds to a specific type of data retrieval:
	
		=> getCity(): Retrieves a list of cities along with their codes from the database.
		=> getType(): Retrieves a list of types along with their codes from the database.
		=> getValue(int cityCode, int typeCode): Retrieves a list of values based on the provided city code and type code from the database.
		=> getUtilization(int city_code, int type_code, String value): Retrieves utilization data based on the provided city code, type code, and value from the database.
		
	- These methods execute SQL queries using JDBC to interact with the database and retrieve data.
	
Error Handling:

	- The methods include error handling to catch any exceptions that may occur during database operations. 
	
	- Exceptions are logged to the console for debugging purposes.
	
Connection Management:

	- The close() method is a utility method used to close the database connection, prepared statement, and result set after database operations are completed. 
	- This helps in releasing database resources and preventing memory leaks.
	
Connection Configuration:

	- The database connection URL, username, and password are hard-coded within each method. 
	- In a production environment, it's common to externalize these configurations using properties files or environment variables for better flexibility and security.
