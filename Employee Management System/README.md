This project includes a simple employee management which involves:

  i) Front-end => HTML,CSS,JS
  
  ii) Backend => Java , Sprinboot
  
  iii) Database => MySql
  

The HTML code represents a simple Employee Management System frontend. 

It consists of a form to add new employees and a button to retrieve existing employee data from the backend. 

This frontend interacts with the backend to perform CRUD operations on employee data (Create, Read, Delete, Update).

Users can add new employees and view existing employee details through this interface.
